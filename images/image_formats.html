    <h4>PNGs</h3>
     <p> The options available for PNGs are very similar to that of GIFs, they are limited to the same amount of simple files.
       A PNG can often help ou get a smaller file then a GIF but with the same quality. Often times a PNG can actually be better then
       a GIF quality wise and can handle transparency better then a GIF can.
       However, a PNG can weigh down a site with its file size more then that of a
       GIF or a JPG. Another downsaid of using PNGs with transparent backrounds is that
       the image format is not always supported by the website browser.
    <h4>JPGs</h4>
     <p> JPGs are best to you when working iwth photos of grafics with complex effects
       such as shadows and gradients. JPGs also offer
       the option to work with a wide range of colors. JPGs allow for you to change the qualtiy
       of the image, the best solution is usually somewhere in between the lowest and highest quality settings.
    <h4>GIFs</h4>
     <p> This is the most complicated image form. GIFs are restricted to 256 colors
       and should not be use excessivly. The 256 colors make it possible for a very clear and colorized image
       to be produced and saved.
