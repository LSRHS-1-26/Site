        <td> He drives Alina to her apartment. He asks her if she's
           heard of that audition that they were holding nearby where
           he bumped into her. She told him she had but she never really
           auditioned. He tells her that he's co-starring in the movie
           and though she would be perfect for the other lead role.
           He tells he it would be no problem for him to get her a new
            audition and promises hell even be there to watch. She agrees.  The End :) </td>
