        <td> He tells her his sister is 7 and doubts
           theres any way she knows her. She is speechless
           but he laughs it off and they get to talking and He
           asks her if she's heard of that audition that they were holding
           nearby where he bumped into her. She told him she had but she never
           really auditioned. He tells her that he's co-starring in the movie
           and though she would be perfect for the other lead role.
           He tells he it would be no problem for him to get her a
           new audition and promises hell even be there to watch. She agrees. The End :) </td>
