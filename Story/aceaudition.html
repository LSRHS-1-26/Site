        <th colspan="3"> Alina aces her audition! The people auditioning decided to cast
          her as the lead role. Alina is shocked and asks them
           why they would cast a walk on. They tell her that they wanted
           some fresh talent and thats why they held the audition in the
           first place. Alina tries to decided whether or not she wants to tell
            Meghan right away. She's scared that Megan might get mad that
          Alina did better then she did even though Meghan is the acting major.
