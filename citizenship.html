    <h1>Citizenship</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
      <h4>Honesty</h4>
        <d1> Definition: "free from fraud or deception: legitimate, truthful"
            <dd> Honesty is an essential characteristic of a good citizen becuase without honesty,
               its hard for good relationsips to form between people in your community, especially if they are finding
             out that you have not been being truthful with them. The more open and honest you are wth people around you,
             the easier it is to build stronger relationships with them. </dd>

          is important to know how to be self sufficient. Responsiblity is also important in the case of ownngup to what you have

      <h4> My Most Recent Act of Citizenship </h4>
        <d1> Respect
          <dd> Last week in the lunch room, my friends and I were talking about differt events that are going on in the United States
            currently. My views on some poitical aspects of the conversation were much differnt from those of another girl at the table,
            we both shared our ideas but insted of arguing we respectfully acknowledged that our views were just dfferent and it was
            no reason to argue.
